Also, it's crucial that you turn off HTTP TRACE support on all webservers.
An attacker can steal cookie data via Javascript even when document.cookie is disabled
 or not supported on the client.
This attack is mounted when a user posts a malicious script to a forum so when another user clicks the link,
 an asynchronous HTTP Trace call is triggered which collects the user's cookie information from the server,
 and then sends it over to another malicious server that collects the cookie information so the attacker
 can mount a session hijack attack. 
This is easily mitigated by removing support for HTTP TRACE on all webservers.
