okay you are setting up an investment system
explain

14:43
Chris Kennedy
Yeah
Okay well I'm doing a course on programming and databases etc
But I'm doing a project on building an investment system
I can build it np for the application and the webpage and database behind that's all fine

14:44
Michel Georges
okay

14:44
Chris Kennedy
But to make it look as professional as possible I was hoping to get some input from yourself on
what someone in the business sector would look for in a webpage, both; on the initial look of the page and then if they registered 
etc and then from a login point of view

14:44
Michel Georges
but what do you need
like how can i help
what insight

14:44
Chris Kennedy
Advice on what a blood leeching business fuck would look for
What mindframe would someone who's interested in investing, look for aesthetically
The functionality behind I can work with I just need ideas on what you would find to be good

14:45
Michel Georges
this: http://www.bloomberg.com/

14:45
Chris Kennedy
You study economics I gather some business side behind that interms of marketing you must have touched on

14:45
Michel Georges
make it look
like a wallet
make them feel important
people that are in business generally are entitled and feel pre-ordained
so my assumption is milk it
put stock shares the go from left to right etc. what new investment opportunities are on the rise
in the near future
the mentality of a business man is cut to the chase
give me information i need
thats useful. dont give me any fat. just lean meat, data, and useful data

14:48
Chris Kennedy
Mk

14:48
Michel Georges
and plenty of propaganda shit

14:48
Chris Kennedy
This is really useful

14:48
Michel Georges
left wing right wing

14:49
Chris Kennedy
Yeah I was thinking the mindset of: "Give the psychopaths numbers, charts and a minimal layout that is terse"

14:49
Michel Georges
yes
exactly

14:49
Chris Kennedy
Okay critical part, I hope you're not busy btw
What would you remove/add to the bloomberg site
What seems pointless and missing

14:49
Michel Georges
i am exam at 7pm but i dont care

14:50
Chris Kennedy
Oh okay
fuck it
I'm more special

14:50
Michel Georges
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/

14:50
Chris Kennedy
So what would you add / remove

14:50
Michel Georges
you have to put yourself in the mindset
of a curious investor
maybe some gaming companies like riot
i bet their stock share is fucking high atm
advice lots and lots of advice
maybe some politicartoons here and there
that pander to wall street facists

14:52
Chris Kennedy
Mk mk
Excuse my naivity but aren't wall street = investors?

14:52
Michel Georges
if you gave me more info i'd be less useless.
yes.

14:52
Chris Kennedy
Lol kk

14:53
Michel Georges
let me explain
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-hot-button/stockbrokers-more-reckless-than-psychopaths-study/article617730/
thats why they like to see the figures and the lean data
because they are fucked up people:P

14:54
Chris Kennedy
I can relate
I'm a partial sociopath so I'm told
But basically to make you understand why i'm doing this is
I'm focused more on the security of the site

14:55
Michel Georges
but yeah. lots of investment opportunity articles. Stock market numbers. make it look business-like
these people go to work in a suite and tie
and go to sleep in them
so they like it tidy because it means status

14:56
Chris Kennedy
And the encryption mechanism and database setup is all done with impenetrable results

14:56
Michel Georges
so the more tidy and businessy thge more they will take you serious

14:56
Chris Kennedy
Okay
Well I was looking at these example sites
Which all had that multicultural smiley faces and shit
I was thinking of bypassing that
Show examples of statistics charts organisation of which

14:56
Michel Georges
oh and business people still wear 100 000 dollar watches because it means status even though our fone has a clock

14:57
Chris Kennedy
And keep mentioning that it's secure

14:57
Michel Georges
so put a watch up maybe. and have it sponsored by omega
or something more expensive

14:57
Chris Kennedy
Kk
So it's all ego feeding
I want to tailor thissite to their ego

14:57
Michel Georges
and numbers
yep

14:57
Chris Kennedy
show minimal amounts of text

14:57
Michel Georges
also
fear mongering is great

14:57
Chris Kennedy
Figures figures figures and data
How so?

14:58
Michel Georges
make your clients insecure as to NEED you
like

14:58
Chris Kennedy
Give me and example of which

14:58
Michel Georges
once in a while in your news articles
include one or 2 that instigate a little shit your pantsyness
dow jones closes at all time low
or
oil supplies running low
shit like tha
t
if all is good in the hood all the time then there's no reason to read the news
coz
allz good
erryday

15:00
Chris Kennedy
Hmm okay
So be pessimistic with news feeds?
Show whats being fucked

15:00
Michel Georges
no be optimistic and have a few here and there that are scary

15:00
Chris Kennedy
Rather than +2 points to john does farm wor whatever

15:00
Michel Georges
variation is key

15:00
Chris Kennedy
Okay
How would you quantify it, in terms of balance
4 good news 1 bad?

15:01
Michel Georges
no. 1-1 i think would be better. so its like a news source. people want to hear good news about themselves and bad news about others.
LIBERALS PUSH BILL TO TAX STOCK REVENUE
etc
doesnt mean the bill has passed
nor will it
but it might happen
but the title says it is going to happen
thats how fox news does it
god i should never work
i'd be the most horrible extortionist ever
like mormons preying on single mothers

15:03
Chris Kennedy
Okay
So mind games and back and forth with balance
Between good nad bad

15:04
Michel Georges
concur
and lota data
dont forget stock market ups and downs
dono if u can take that from bloomberg i dono how to program

15:05
Chris Kennedy
I can do that myself with c#
Don't sweat about making the programs I can make that shit work

15:05
Michel Georges
okay

15:05
Chris Kennedy
few late nights and a pot of coffee

15:05
Michel Georges
and dead hookers

15:05
Chris Kennedy
It's the effective layout and psychology behind it that I want

15:05
Michel Georges
wallstreet loves those

15:05
Chris Kennedy
I have a mate with a psychology Hdeg helping me with the psychology aswell and your help is awesome too
This project will fucking destroy mayne

15:06
Michel Georges

15:35
Chris Kennedy
Well the idea is that I want to focus more on enticing them to the page and show them on their portfolio pages their specific pages and stocks that they subscribe to feed them RSS streams of stocks and expensive business stocks that they may be "watching" or what have you
But the advice you gave me was awesome help tyvm and this track is class lol
